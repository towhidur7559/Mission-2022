                   <p>A life without any aim is like a ship without a rudder. An aim helps a man to gain his coveted objective, his career. It is like a torch that enlightens a person's career.</p>

                        <p>Some people want to earn money, some want to earn fame and some want to serve others. I had to think a lot to choose my aim/profession/career in life. I think, it should be decided according to one's aptitude, ability and merit. Considering these, my choice is the simple wish to be a teacher.</p>

                        <p>Undoubtedly, teaching is a very noble profession. A teacher is like a potter who works on wheel to give shape to his pots, cutting out the rough edges to give a perfect finish to the end product. At present, neither the students nor the teachers have the same sincerity and singleness of purpose.</p>

                        <p>However, there are still some exceptional teachers who are genuinely concerned about the future of their pupils and try to guide them sincerely.</p>

                  <p>One cannot overlook the advantages one has as a teacher. One gets so many holidays which can be used to catch up with other interests one neglects on working days. This is really a very tempting prospect. Besides, over the years the salary of teachers has also become very attractive.</p>
